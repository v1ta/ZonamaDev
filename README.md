## Linux Host

### Linux mint 17.3 / Ubuntu 14.04
First install git, curl, and zlib1g-dev via
````
sudo apt-get install git curl zlib1g-dev
````
Next install Vagrant and VirtualBox through their websites:
 * [VirtualBox for Linux](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

Choose linux version (use 14.04 ubuntu as Linux Mint is based on 14.04)

 * [Vagrant for Linux](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Download the debian package for vagrant.  (The versions in the apt-get repos are older, and unsupported for ZonamaDev)

Install downloaded packages:
````
sudo dpkg -i <pathtofile>/<nameoffile>
````
Type:
````
curl -Lk http://downloads.zonamaserver.org/zonamadev/bootstrap.sh | bash
````
Watch for error messages, and resolve any unmet dependancy problems.  Each distro of linux has different versions:
For example, on Debian Testing (Stretch) install should be able to do apt-get virtualbox and vagrant.

### Updates

The system should update on reboot, please reboot the vm:

* via the applications menu "Loggout -> Restart"
* via host control: vagrant reload
* via terminal: sudo init 6

### Advanced Featues

#### DESTROY AND START FRESH

To uninstall and re-install fresh on the host system type:

````
curl -Lk http://downloads.zonamaserver.org/zonamadev/bootstrap.sh | bash -s destroy
````

#### UNINSTALL

To uninstall on the host system type:

````
curl -Lk http://downloads.zonamaserver.org/zonamadev/bootstrap.sh | bash -s uninstall
````

#### SPECIFY RELEASE

As an example to install release-1.5 before it becomes mainline:

````
curl -Lk http://downloads.zonamaserver.org/zonamadev/bootstrap.sh | bash -s release 1.5
````

#### SPECIFY BRANCH

As an example to QA a new branch called "feature-lotto-numbers-1":

````
curl -Lk http://downloads.zonamaserver.org/zonamadev/bootstrap.sh | bash -s branch feature-lotto-numbers-1
````

#### Local config for core and ram

On the host (usually Windows or OSX) in the ~/ZonamdaDev/fasttrack directory you can create a simple YAML file that sets cores and/or ram:

Example config.yml:
```yaml
cores: 8
ram: 8192
```
The config.yml is ignored in .gitignore so you can "set it and forget it".

You can also setup a "bridged" network interface if you want the server to be directly on your LAN:

````yaml
bridge: "auto"
```

Under windows you can do 'auto' and it usually picks the right interface on OSX you will need to choose the right
interface often "en0":

````yaml
bridge: "en0"
```

The next time you do vagrant reload or vagrant up these settings will take effect.
